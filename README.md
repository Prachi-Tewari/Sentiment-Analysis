# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis of amazon reviews using NLP and Logistic Regression.
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in Amazon product reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

**Overview:**

The project involves training a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of Amazon product reviews as positive or negative based on the text content.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:** Utilizing a dataset consisting of Amazon product reviews along with their sentiment labels (positive or negative).

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of reviews to prepare them as input for the machine learning model.

3. **Model Selection:** Applying a classification model, such as logistic regression or support vector machine (SVM), to classify sentiment based on the processed text data.

4. **Model Training:** Training the selected model on a portion of the dataset to learn patterns and associations between review text and sentiment labels.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in sentiment classification.

6. **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict sentiment for new Amazon reviews, thereby automating sentiment analysis tasks.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used comprises a collection of Amazon product reviews, each labeled with sentiment polarity (positive or negative), making it suitable for training and testing sentiment analysis models.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK)
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
